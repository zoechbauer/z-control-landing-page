# What's New

All recent updates and improvements to our landing page.

## [1.2] - July 2, 2025

### üêõ Fixes

- **QR Code App: Email Client Issue on iPad Fixed**
  - **Issue**: Email client was not opening on iPad/Safari when using the "Mail code" button
  - **Root Cause**: Safari on iOS blocks `mailto:` actions when triggered simultaneously with file downloads, treating multiple programmatic actions as potentially suspicious
